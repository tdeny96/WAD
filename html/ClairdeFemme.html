		       In search of forgetting, Lydia and Michel do what they can to overcome the pain of a loss, imminent for one, recent for the other. With a gentle swinging motion, 
			  Romain Gary shows them sometimes close, sometimes a thousand leagues apart. And to accompany this dance, full of sadness but which can not help but hope a little, the time of 
			  the story is the slave of capricious memory.
			   In the background, some colorful characters, such as Se√±or Galba and his poodle who defy death by dancing the paso-doble or Sonia, cartoon alone of all expatriate white
			Russians, come to illuminate this poignant back and forth . --Sana Tang-Leopold Wauters

          "  To love is the only wealth that grows with prodigality. The more you give and the more you have left. [...] Less is left of each one, and more remains of the two [...] 
		  I will live until the oldest age, to give you my memory. I will always have homeland, land, spring, garden and house: a woman`s flash. A movement of hips, a flight of hair, some wrinkles 
		  that we will have written together, and I will know where I am from. "
