		Book Description: During a summer party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood 
		                  tree house and is happily dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks 
						  to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime.

		<pre id="demo" style="display:none">
		       A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy—her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother.
               Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London. The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy`s ninetieth 
			   birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can 
			   only be found in Dorothy`s past.Dorothy`s story takes the reader from pre–WWII England through the blitz, to the `60s and beyond. It is the secret history 
			   of three strangers from vastly different worlds—Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy—who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. 
			   The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception 
			   and passion that is told—in Morton`s signature style—against a backdrop of events that changed the world.
