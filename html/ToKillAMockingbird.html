		    Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - 
			to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print 
			and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always 
			considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.

          "    Atticus said to Jem one day, "I would rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard, but I know you will go after birds. 
		  Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit them, but remember it is a sin to kill a mockingbird." That was the only time I ever 
		  heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. "Your father is right," she said. 
		  "Mockingbirds do not do one thing except make music for us to enjoy.They do not eat up people`s gardens, do not nest in corn cribs, 
		  they do not do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That is why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird.	"
