		      In 2004, Simon & Schuster plublished the Know-It-All. It subsequently spent eight weeks on the New York Times paperback bestseller list. It was praised by Time 
		magazine, Newsweek, Vanity Fair, USA Today, Janet Maslin in the New York Times and AJ’s uncle Henry on Amazon.com.
		      Jacobs has appeared on Oprah, The Today Show, Good Morning America and the second-to-last episode of the John McEnroe Show on MSNBC, which also featured Dionne 
	    Warwick wearing a fannypack.
		      He is a periodic commentator on NPR`s Weekend Edition Saturday, where he discusses important facts, such as the fact that oppossums have 13 nipples.
			  In the fall of 2007, the Year of Living Biblically was released. It appeared on the NYT bestseller list, and was praised by Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, 
		The New York Times Book Review, the Los Angeles Times, USA Today and others. It appeared on the cover of the evangelical magazine Relevant, but was also featured in 
		Penthouse. (Jacobs is proud to be a uniter, not a divider). It will be released in paperback on September 9, 2008.
		      Jacobs has signed on to write two more books for Simon & Schuster. The first is called Life Is an Experiment, and will contain both original essays and 
	    previously published pieces, including “My Outsourced Life,” Jacobs` quest to delegate every task in his life to India. The second is called The Healthiest Human Being 
		in the World and it continues Jacobs` experiential journalism series as he tries to perfect his physical condition while simultaneously dissecting the meaning of the word 
		"healthiest."
		      Jacobs grew up in New York City. His father is a lawyer who holds the world record for the most footnotes in a law review article (4,824). His wife works for a 
		highbrow scavenger hunt called Watson Adventures. He lives in New York. He wonders if he fooled anyone with this third-person thing, or if everyone knows that he wrote this 
		bio himself.
