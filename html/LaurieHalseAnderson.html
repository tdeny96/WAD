	  Date Of Birth: October 23, 1961;
	  Place Of Birth: Potsdam, New York, USA ;
	  Nationality: American;
	  Genre : Young fiction;
	  Early Years:Laurie Beth Halse was born to Rev. Frank A. Halse Jr. and Joyce Holcomb Halse in Potsdam, New York. She grew up there with her younger sister,
	              Lisa. As a student, she showed an early interest in writing, specifically during the second grade. Anderson enjoyed reading—especially science fiction
				  and fantasy—as a teenager, but never envisioned herself becoming a writer.
                  Anderson attended Fayetteville-Manlius High School, in Manlius, New York, a suburb of Syracuse.
                 During Anderson`s senior year, she moved out of her parents` house at the age of sixteen and lived as an exchange student for thirteen months on a pig 
				 farm in Denmark. After her experience in Denmark, Anderson moved back home to work at a clothing store, earning the minimum wage. 
				 This motivated her to attend college.
                 After attending Onondaga Community College, she transferred to Georgetown University in 1981 
				 and graduated in 1984 with a bachelor`s degree in languages and linguistics.
