		Book Description:  From the bestselling author of "The Know-It-All" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but 
		increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for 
		one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid 
		wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.

            The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history`s most influential book 
		with new eyes. 
		    Jacobs`s quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire "Encyclopedia Britannica" for "The Know-It-All." His beard grows so unruly 
		that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all
		situations - much to his wife`s chagrin.
		     Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings
		hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah`s Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling 
		relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs`s extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and 
		challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, "The Year of Living Biblically" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into 
		worlds unimaginable. Thou shalt not be able to put it down.

         " I`ve started to look at life differently. When you're thanking God for every little you - every meal, every time you wake up, every time you take a sip of water - you can`t
		  help but be more thankful for life itself, for the unlikely and miraculous fact that you exist at all."
