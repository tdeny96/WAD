		    Near the turn of the 20th century, fiery Marta leaves Switzerland determined to find life on her own terms. Her journey takes her through Europe and finally lands 
			her with children and husband in tow in the central valley of California. Marta`s experiences convince her that only the strong survive. Hildie, Marta`s oldest 
			daughter, has a heart to serve others, and her calling as a nurse gives her independence, if not the respect of her mother. Amid the drama of WWII,Hildie marries and 
			begins a family of her own. She wants her daughter never to doubt her love, but the challenges of life conspire against her vow. Each woman is forced to confront her
			faulty but well-meaning desire to help her daughter find her God-given place in the world.

          " "I wonder what they`d say if they knew my father came from Germany and my mother is Swiss." 
		  If not for Mama`s correspondence with Rosie Brechtwald, they wouldn`t have known how the Swiss threatened to blow the main tunnel into the country if one German 
		  stood in the light at the end of it. But that didn`t stop them from making money off the war selling munitions to the Germans and transporting goods between the
		  Third Reich and Mussolini. Rosie said it was the only way they could remain free. Mama grieved over freedom being purchased with blood money."
