		        A twenty-five-year-old Aramaic scholar, Antoine has had it with being brilliant and deeply self-aware in today`s culture. So tortured is he by the depth of his perception and 
			understanding of himself and the world around him that he vows to denounce his intelligence by any means necessary in order to become stupid enough to be a happy, functioning member 
			of society. What follows is a dark and hilarious odyssey as Antoine tries everything from alcoholism to stock-trading in order to lighten the burden of his brain on his soul.

        " When we try to understand something, more often than not, we kill it, and now I can feel the dangers of this encroaching on me: cynicism, bitterness, and infinite sadness...It`s 
		  impossible to live if you're too aware, too thoughtful. Take nature for example: everything that lives happily and too a ripe old age is not very intelligent. Tortoises live for centuries,
		  water's immortal, and Milton Friedman`s still alive."
