		    Sierra Madrid`s life has just been turned upside down when she discovers the handcrafted quilt and journal of her ancestor Mary Kathryn McMurray, 
			a young woman who was uprooted from her home only to endure harsh conditions on the Oregon Trail. Though the women are separated by time and circumstance, 
			Sierra discovers that many of the issues they face are remarkably similar. By following Mary Kathryn`s example, Sierra learns to surrender to God`s sovereignty 
			and unconditional love.
