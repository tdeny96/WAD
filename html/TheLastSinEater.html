          " I was learning to recognize when God was speaking through someone. He repeats himself. He says it over and over because we are so stubborn, stupid and unwilling. And even scared. 
		  Even when He tells us not to be afraid, we set our minds about it, worrying and fretting about every little thing. I was shaken by what God expected us to do."
