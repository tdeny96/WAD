	  Date Of Birth:15th of March 1979;
	  Place Of Birth: Surrey, United Kingdom ;
	  Nationality: British;
	  Genre : Non-Fiction, Biographies, Memories;
	  Early Years: Bowen was born in Surrey in March 1979. Following his parents` divorce, he moved to Australia with his mother. Because they moved frequently, Bowen was often 
	  bullied at school. He later dropped out of education in his second year of high school, becoming a self-confessed "tearaway kid" who would later be diagnosed with ADHD, 
	  schizophrenia and manic depression. In 1997, he returned to the United Kingdom to live with his half-sister and her husband. Tensions arose and the arrangement did not last.
	  In time, he began sleeping on the streets. For the next few years, Bowen either slept in the streets or stayed in shelters. He began using heroin to escape from the
	  realities of homelessness.

		      In Spring 2007, Bowen was enrolled on a methadone programme, busking in Covent Garden, and living in a supported housing programme in Tottenham, London. One evening he 
		   returned home to find a ginger cat in the hallway of his building. Assuming it belonged to another resident, he simply returned to his flat. When the cat was still there 
		   the following day, and the day after that, Bowen became concerned and discovered the cat was wearing no collar or ID tag, and had an infected wound on his leg.
		   Bowen checked with other residents to see if the stray belonged to any of them, and when none of them claimed ownership of the animal Bowen decided to help the cat 
		   himself. 
		      According to the account in A Street Cat Named Bob, Bowen took the cat to the nearby Blue Cross clinic, which provided antibiotics to treat the infected wound. 
		  To make sure the cat received the full two-week course of medication, Bowen took him in for a time, while he continued to look for the stray`s owner. When he couldn`t 
		  find any information, he released the cat back on to the street, hoping he`d find his own way home. Instead, he began to follow Bowen around, even following him 
		  onto the bus when he left to go busking. Concerned that the cat had nowhere else to go, Bowen took him in permanently, naming him Bob after a character from the
		  television drama Twin Peaks.
		      Since Bob constantly followed James when he was going to work, he got him a harness for safety and allowed him to come along to his regular spots in Covent 
		   Garden and Piccadilly, travelling in the window seat of the number 73 bus. The public reaction was positive and the pair became popular, their visibility increasing
		   still further when Bowen began selling The Big Issue. The public began uploading videos of Bowen and Bob to YouTube, and tourists would visit Covent Garden to see them.
		   During this time, Bowen decided to conclude his methadone treatment. He credits this development to Bob, saying "I believe it came down to this little man. He came and 
		   asked me for help, and he needed me more than I needed to abuse my own body. He is what I wake up for every day now... heâ€™s definitely given me the right direction
		   to live my life."

          "  I was raised as a churchgoer but I wasn`t a practising Christian. I wasn`t an agnostic or atheist either. My view is that we should all take a bit from every religion 
		  and philosophy. I`m not a Buddhist but I like Buddhist philosophies, in particular. They give you a very good structure that you can build your life around. For instance,
		  I definitely believe in karma, the idea that what goes around, comes around. I wondered whether Bob was my reward for having done something good, somewhere in my troubled 
		  life. "
