		Book Description: Once Leota’s garden was a place of beauty, where her flowers bloomed and hoped thrived. It was her refuge from the deep wounds inflicted by a

		    Now, eighty-four year old Leota Reinhardt is alone, her beloved garden in ruins. All of her efforts to reconcile with her adult children have been fruitless 
			and she voices her despair to a loving Father, her only friend.  Then God brings a wind of change through unlikely means: one, a college student who thinks he 
			has all the answers; the other, the granddaughter Leota never hoped to know. But can the devastation wrought by keeping painful family secrets be repaired before 
			she runs out of time?

		  As the weather warmed, miniature purple irises would rise amid the volunteers of white alyssum and verbena. The roses, dahlias, white Shasta daisies, black-eyed Susans, 
		  and marigolds would bloom from late spring to early fall. Leota could see it. She knew exactly"
