		  Author quote:
          "  At the very beginning of a project, when I`m working with my notebooks, 
		  scribbling down ideas, researching, and letting the story come to life in my imagination, one of the aspects 
		  I`m keenest to discover is the world in which the action takes place. 
		  The setting is part of it, but it`s more than that, too: it`s a texture, a flavour, an atmosphere. 
		  I need the world to feel vivid and real and denseâ€”the sort of place in which you and I can both become lost.  "
