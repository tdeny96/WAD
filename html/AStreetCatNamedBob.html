          "    There's a famous quote I read somewhere. It says we are all given second chances every day of our lives. They are there for the taking, it's just 
		   that we don't usually take them. 
		       I spend a big chunk of my life proving that quote. I was given a lot of opportunities, sometimes on a daily basis.For a long time I failed to take  
		   any of them, but then, in the early spring of 2007, that finally began to change. It was then that I befriended Bob. Looking back on it, something tells 
		   me it may have been his second chance too.	"
