		Book Description:  Growing up isn`t easy for little Carolyn Arundel. With her mother, Hildemara, quarantined to her room with tuberculosis, Carolyn forms a special bond 
		with her oma Marta, who moves in to care for the household. But as tensions between Hildie and Marta escalate, Carolyn believes she is to blame. When Hildie returns to 
		work and Marta leaves, Carolyn and her brother grow up as latchkey kids in a world gripped by the fear of the Cold War.

		    College offers Carolyn the chance to find herself, but a family tragedy shatters her new found independence. Rather than return home, she cuts all ties and disappears 
			into the heady counter culture of San Francisco. When she re-emerges two years later, more lost than ever, she reluctantly turns to her family to help rebuild a
			life for her and her own daughter, May Flower Dawn.
		      	Just like Carolyn, May Flower Dawn develops a closer bond with her grandmother, Hildie, than with her mother, causing yet another rift between generations.
			But as Dawn struggles to avoid the mistakes of those who went before her, she vows that somehow she will be a bridge between the women in her family rather than the 
			wall that separates them forever.

          " Now, she couldn`t sleep. Rather than get back into bed, Hildie sat in a chair by the window and looked out at the stars. What was it going to be like, having Mama 
		  living under her roof, taking care of her, taking care of her children, taking care of all the chores that needed to be done so Trip didn`t have to do everything? 
		  Would Mama despise her for not fighting harder? Her eyes burned; her throat ached just thinking about having to lie in bed sick and helpless while Mama took over her 
		  family. She wiped tears away. Of course, Mama would do it all better than she ever could. That realization hurt even more. Mama had always managed everything. 
		  Even without Papa, the ranch ran like a well-oiled machine. Mama would fix Trip wonderful meals. Mama would be the one to give Charlie wings. Mama would probably have 
		  Carolyn reading before she turned four."
