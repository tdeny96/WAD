		Book Description: The House at Riverton is a gorgeous debut novel set in England between the wars. Perfect for fans of "Downton Abbey," it`s the story of an aristocratic family,

		       The novel is full of secrets -- some revealed, others hidden forever, reminiscent of the romantic suspense of Daphne du Maurier. It`s also a meditation on memory and the 
			   devastation of war and a beautifully rendered window into a fascinating time in history.

		  weighed them down.... "
